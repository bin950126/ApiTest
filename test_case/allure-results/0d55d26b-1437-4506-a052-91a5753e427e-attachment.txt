We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</p>\n<p>Transaction Information: We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance travelled, and other related transaction details.</p>\n<p>Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen.
